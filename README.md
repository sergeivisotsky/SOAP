# SOAP
Implementation of SOAP services. By standards is required to have WSDL file for SOAP services which is a description of all service functionality.
WSDL might be written manually what affects a big knowledge of XML or autogenerated

## SOAP Server
To create this server Java EE was used.

To declare endpoint it is required to annotate class with `@WebService` annotation

To declare method to be SOAP method `@WebMethod` annotation is required for every method exists attributes.

From this annotations WSDL is generated which is available by this url [http://localhost:8080/soap/ws/v1/EndpointName?wsdl](http://localhost:8080/soap/ws/v1/EndpointName?wsdl)

WSDL can be customized with annotation attributed like `name`, `targetNamespace`, `action` 

Method parameters can be declared with `@WebParam` annotation.

Endpoint start page: [http://localhost:8080/soap/ws/v1/EndpointName](http://localhost:8080/soap/ws/v1/EndpointName)

## SOAP Client
To consume SOAP services its methods should be extracted from WSDL to perform it `wsimport -keep -verbose http://localhost:8080/soap/ws/v1/CustomerService?wsdl` command should be performed.
